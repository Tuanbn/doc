VEHICLE SAFETY:

1. Safety Guidelines:

Follow these guidelines to enhance your safety: Perform all routine and regular inspections specified in this manual. Stop the engine and keep sparks and flames away before filling the fuel tank. Do not run the engine in enclosed or partly enclosed areas. Carbon monoxide in exhaust gases is toxic and can kill you.

Always Wear a Helmet: It's a proven fact: helmets and protective apparel significantly reduce the number and severity of head and other injuries. So always wear an approved helmet and protective apparel.

Before Riding: Make sure that you are physically fit, mentally focused and free of alcohol and drugs. Check that you and your passenger are both wearing an approved helmet and protective apparel.Instruct your passenger on holding onto the rear carrier or your waist, leaning with you in turns, and keeping their feet on the footpegs, even when the vehicle is stopped.

Take Time to Learn & Practice:Even if you have ridden other vehicles, practice riding in a safe area to become familiar with how this vehicle works and handles, and to become accustomed to the vehicle's size and weight.

Ride Defensively: Always pay attention to other vehicles around you, and do not assume that other drivers see you. Be prepared to stop quickly or perform an evasive maneuver.

Make Yourself Easy to See: Make yourself more visible, especially at night, by wearing bright reflective clothing, positioning yourself so other drivers can see you, signaling before turning or changing lanes, and using your horn when necessary.

Ride within Your Limits: Never ride beyond your personal abilities or faster than conditions warrant. Fatigue and inattention can impair your ability to use good judgement and ride safely.

Don't Drink or Use Drugs and Ride: Alcohol or drugs and riding don't mix. Even one alcoholic drink can reduce your ability to respond to changing conditions, and your reaction time gets worse with every additional drink. The same is true for drug use. Don't drink or use and ride, and don't let your friends do it either.

Keep Your Honda in Safe Condition: It's important to keep your vehicle properly maintained and in safe riding condition. Inspect your vehicle before every ride and perform all recommended maintenance. Never exceed load limits, and do not modify your vehicle or install accessories that would make your vehicle unsafe.

If You are Involved in a Crash: Personal safety is your first priority. If you or anyone else has been injured, take time to assess the severity of the injuries and whether it is safe to continue riding. Call for emergency assistance if needed. Also follow applicable laws and regulations if another person or vehicle is involved in the crash. If you decide to continue riding, first turn the ignition switch to the ? (Off) position, and evaluate the condition of your vehicle. Inspect for fluid leaks, check the tightness of critical nuts and bolts, and check the handlebar, control levers, brakes, and wheels. Ride slowly and cautiously. Your vehicle may have suffered damage that is not immediately apparent. Have your vehicle thoroughly checked at a qualified service facility as soon as possible.

Carbon Monoxide Hazard: Exhaust contains poisonous carbon monoxide, a colourless, odorless gas. Breathing carbon monoxide can cause loss of consciousness and may lead to death. If you run the engine in a confined or even partly enclosed area, the air you breathe could contain a dangerous amount of carbon monoxide. Never run your vehicle inside a garage or other enclosure. Warning: Running the engine of your vehicle while in an enclosed or even partially enclosed area can cause a rapid buildup of toxic carbon monoxide gas. Breathing this colourless, odorless gas can quickly cause unconsciousness and lead to death. Only run your vehicle's engine when it is located in a well ventilated area outdoors
